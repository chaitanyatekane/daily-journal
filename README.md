Notes :-

1. when you don't have node modules, then just type in terminal (so that, it will install all dependencies) - > npm install
2. Components start with capital letter
3. In JSX we write class as className, because class is reversed keyword in javascript
4. In older versions of react (less than version 17), we need to import react at top of file inside the components to work, but now no need to do this in version 17 and above.
5. A component in a nutshell is a function which returns something (JSX templates)
6. React converts whatever datatype we use to string before it outputs on a browser (we can output numbers, strings, arrays, the only thing we cannot output on browser is booleans and objects)
